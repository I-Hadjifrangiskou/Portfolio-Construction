# Quant Portfolio Strategy Exploration

This project explores a series of quantitative strategies for equity portfolio construction, based on both hand-crafted factor signals and machine learning predictions. This is a first attempt at a structure that I believe a quant research team may approach building, evaluating, and comparing different alpha models using real financial data.

## 1. Factor-Based Portfolios

Constructed and backtested portfolios using several well-known quant factors:

### Momentum

- Calculated using a 6-month return (126-day lookback).
- Ranked cross-sectionally and top 20% selected daily.

### Volatility Risk Premium (VRP)

- Defined as the difference between implied volatility and realized volatility.
- Implied volatility was calculated using the Black-Scholes formula by inverting observed option prices for a single day (ATM call options).
- Assumed this implied volatility to be fixed over the entire date range for each stock, a simplification that reduces noise but does not reflect real market dynamics.
- Realized volatility was computed as the rolling 21-day standard deviation of returns, annualized.

### Combined Factor

- A z-score normalized combination of momentum and VRP.
- Equal-weighted composite score used to rank stocks and select top 20% for portfolio construction.

### Strategy Performance Metrics

| Strategy        | Annualised Sharpe Ratio | Max Drawdown |
|----------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Momentum        | 0.939                    | -40.8%        |
| VRP             | 0.797                    | -37.2%        |
| Combined        | **0.964**                | **-35.3%**    |

> ðŸ“ˆ **Conclusion**: The combined strategy outperforms both individual strategies in Sharpe ratio and drawdown, suggesting a better risk-adjusted return profile.

## 2. Machine Learning Strategy

Implemented a machine learning model to predict future returns from factor inputs:

- **Inputs (Features):**
  - Z-score normalized momentum and VRP.

- **Target:**
  - Next-day return (also tested with 5-day lookahead).

- **Model:**
  - Ridge Regression (regularized linear model), somewhat robust in low-sample settings.
  - Training was done on the first 80% of the date range, and predictions were made for the remaining 20%.

- **Portfolio Construction:**
  - Stocks were ranked daily by predicted return.
  - Top 20% selected to build an equal-weighted portfolio.

### Results

- The ML strategy underperformed compared to simple factor-based strategies.
- Example: ML strategy reached a growth factor of ~1.3 over the test period, while the combined factor strategy reached ~3.5.

#### ML Strategy Plot

### Potential Reasons for Underperformance

- Low number of stocks (only 5 tickers), limiting cross-sectional learning.
- Daily returns are noisy and hard to predict.
- Possible overfitting or insufficient signal strength in the features.
- The top-n portfolio construction method may discard useful predictive signals when the model output is tightly clustered.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Simple factor models (momentum, VRP) can outperform ML-based strategies in low-data regimes.
- Combined factor strategies offer better performance and risk control than individual factors.
- Machine learning requires careful tuning, validation, and large, diverse datasets to show its full power in return prediction.
- Model comparison, performance attribution, and robustness testing are essential parts of quant strategy evaluation.

## Future Improvements

- Use rolling-window ML training for a more realistic backtest.
- Try additional features (e.g., price volatility, beta, sector dummies).
- Expand the stock universe to improve cross-sectional depth.
- Experiment with score-weighted rather than binary top-N portfolios.
